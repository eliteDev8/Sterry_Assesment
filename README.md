### Design Explanation
- **Stateless API server**: Built with Node.js/Express for scalability and maintainability.
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for ACID compliance, relational modeling, and scalability.
- **Message Queue**: (RabbitMQ/Redis) for decoupled, asynchronous event processing (e.g., notifications, analytics, integrations).
- **Swagger UI**: For interactive, self-documenting API reference.
- **Dockerized**: Ensures consistent environments for dev, test, and production.
- **See the sequence diagram above for a visual of all major request flows, including validation, DB interaction, event publishing, and error handling.**

## Project Description
A robust, extensible backend for task management, designed for production-readiness, team collaboration, and future integrations. The system supports:
- CRUD operations on tasks
- Filtering, sorting, and validation
- Event-driven architecture for integrations
- Comprehensive testing (unit/integration)
- Interactive API documentation

- **Database:** Use managed PostgreSQL (e.g., AWS RDS), enable read replicas, partitioning, and connection pooling.
- **Queue:** Use RabbitMQ/Kafka for high-throughput, persistent messaging.
- **Caching:** Add Redis/Memcached for hot data.
- **Object storage:** Use S3 for file/attachment scalability.
- **Monitoring:** Centralized logging, metrics, and alerting (CloudWatch, ELK, Prometheus).
- **CI/CD:** Automated tests, builds, and blue/green deployments.
- **API Gateway:** For rate limiting, auth, and traffic shaping.

**Leadership Commentary:**
- Designed for cloud-native, microservice-ready deployment.
- All components can be independently scaled and replaced as needed.

| DevOps Engineer     | Docker, CI/CD, environment variables, secrets, monitoring             |
| QA Engineer         | Automated and manual testing, test case design, edge case validation  |
| Documentation Lead  | OpenAPI/Swagger, JSDoc, onboarding guides, API usage examples         |

- **Leadership:** Backend Lead ensures architectural vision, code quality, and team alignment
- **Collaboration:** Engineers work in feature squads, use PRs and code reviews
- **Ownership:** Each role has clear deliverables and cross-functional support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Not implemented (would use JWT/OAuth in production)
- **Email/Notification:** Mocked via console logs; real integration would use external services
- **File Uploads:** S3/object storage integration is planned, not implemented
- **Queue Durability:** Redis Pub/Sub is non-durable; for production, use RabbitMQ/Kafka
- **Single Region:** Multi-region failover not implemented, but architecture supports it
- **API Gateway/Security:** Not included, but recommended for production
- **Data Volume:** Designed for thousands of users; can scale further with above strategies

---

  `docker compose up --build`
- **Database and RabbitMQ connection**
  `docker compose up -d`
- **Run tests:**  
  `docker compose run app npm test`
- **Run Project**

### Cloud Infrastructure: Detailed Description & Rationale

#### Component Breakdown

- **Vercel CDN / Edge**  
  Delivers static assets and frontend globally with low latency. Provides edge caching and DDoS protection. Offloads traffic from the API and improves user experience.

- **API Gateway (Vercel/CloudFront)**  
  Central entry point for all API requests. Handles SSL termination, rate limiting, and (optionally) authentication. Routes requests to the correct backend service (API server).

- **API Server (Vercel Serverless or Node.js/Express)**  
  Stateless backend that processes all business logic and API requests. Can be deployed as a serverless function (for auto-scaling and cost efficiency) or as a containerized Node.js app. Connects to the database, message queue, and other services.

- **AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)**  
  Managed, reliable, and scalable relational database. Automated backups, failover, and maintenance. Stores all persistent task data.

- **AWS S3 (Object Storage, future)**  
  Used for file uploads and attachments (e.g., task-related documents). Scalable, durable, and cost-effective storage.

- **AWS SQS / Amazon MQ (Queue)**  
  Decouples event-driven processes (e.g., notifications, analytics, integrations). Ensures reliable delivery and processing of background jobs.

- **Cloud Logs (Vercel/CloudWatch)**  
  Centralized logging and monitoring for all services. Enables alerting, troubleshooting, and auditing.

- **Secrets Manager (Vercel/AWS)**  
  Securely stores and manages sensitive information (DB credentials, API keys). Prevents secrets from being hardcoded or leaked in code/configs.

- **CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)**  
  Automates testing, building, and deployment of the application. Ensures code quality and enables rapid, safe releases. Handles database migrations as part of the deployment process.

- **Swagger UI / API Docs**  
  Provides interactive, always-up-to-date API documentation for developers and integrators.

---

#### How This Supports Scalability, Security, and Maintainability

- **Scalability:**  
  Stateless API and serverless deployment allow for automatic scaling based on demand. CDN and API Gateway distribute load and reduce latency. Managed database and queue services scale independently.

- **Security:**  
  API Gateway and CDN provide DDoS protection and SSL termination. Secrets Manager ensures sensitive data is never exposed in code. IAM roles and least-privilege policies restrict access to resources.

- **Maintainability:**  
  CI/CD automates testing and deployment, reducing manual errors. Centralized logging and monitoring enable fast troubleshooting and proactive alerting. Infrastructure is modular‚Äîcomponents can be upgraded or replaced independently.

- **Production Readiness:**  
  All components are managed services, reducing operational overhead. Automated backups, failover, and monitoring ensure high availability and reliability. The architecture is cloud-native and ready for future integrations (e.g., third-party tools, analytics, notifications).

---

#### Why This Design?

- **Meets assignment requirements** for a scalable, reliable, and maintainable task management service.
- **Balances simplicity and extensibility**‚Äîonly includes what's needed, but is ready for future growth.
- **Demonstrates leadership-level architectural thinking** by considering security, automation, and real-world operations.
