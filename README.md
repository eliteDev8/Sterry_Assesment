### Design Explanation
- **Stateless API server**: Built with Node.js/Express for scalability and maintainability.
- **PostgreSQL**: Chosen for ACID compliance, relational modeling, and scalability.
- **Message Queue**: (RabbitMQ/Redis) for decoupled, asynchronous event processing (e.g., notifications, analytics, integrations).
- **Swagger UI**: For interactive, self-documenting API reference.
- **Dockerized**: Ensures consistent environments for dev, test, and production.
- **See the sequence diagram above for a visual of all major request flows, including validation, DB interaction, event publishing, and error handling.**

## Project Description
A robust, extensible backend for task management, designed for production-readiness, team collaboration, and future integrations. The system supports:
- CRUD operations on tasks
- Filtering, sorting, and validation
- Event-driven architecture for integrations
- Comprehensive testing (unit/integration)
- Interactive API documentation

---

## üöÄ Setup & Running (Docker)

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd sterry
```

### 2. Start the stack (API + PostgreSQL)
```sh
docker compose up --build
```
- **API:** http://localhost:3000
- **Swagger UI:** http://localhost:3000/docs
- **PostgreSQL:** localhost:5432 (user: `sterryuser`, pass: `sterrypass`, db: `sterrydb`)

### 3. Run Tests (in Docker)
```sh
docker compose run app npm test
```
- Runs both unit and integration tests (integration tests use the real DB in Docker Compose).

**Leadership Commentary:**
- Chose proven, widely adopted tech for reliability, maintainability, and team scalability.
- Docker ensures onboarding is fast and environments are consistent.
- Event-driven design (MQ) future-proofs for integrations and async workflows.

---

## üìà Scaling for Large Volumes
- **Stateless API servers:** Easily scale horizontally behind a load balancer.
- **Database:** Use managed PostgreSQL (e.g., AWS RDS), enable read replicas, partitioning, and connection pooling.
- **Queue:** Use RabbitMQ/Kafka for high-throughput, persistent messaging.
- **Caching:** Add Redis/Memcached for hot data.
- **Object storage:** Use S3 for file/attachment scalability.
- **Monitoring:** Centralized logging, metrics, and alerting (CloudWatch, ELK, Prometheus).
- **CI/CD:** Automated tests, builds, and blue/green deployments.
- **API Gateway:** For rate limiting, auth, and traffic shaping.

**Leadership Commentary:**
- Designed for cloud-native, microservice-ready deployment.
- All components can be independently scaled and replaced as needed.

## üë• Team Responsibility Split

| Role                | Responsibilities                                                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Backend Lead        | System architecture, API design, code reviews, deployment strategy     |
| Backend Engineer    | API implementation, DB modeling, integration, testing                 |
| DevOps Engineer     | Docker, CI/CD, environment variables, secrets, monitoring             |
| QA Engineer         | Automated and manual testing, test case design, edge case validation  |
| Documentation Lead  | OpenAPI/Swagger, JSDoc, onboarding guides, API usage examples         |

- **Leadership:** Backend Lead ensures architectural vision, code quality, and team alignment
- **Collaboration:** Engineers work in feature squads, use PRs and code reviews
- **Ownership:** Each role has clear deliverables and cross-functional support

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Assumptions & Limitations
- **Authentication/Authorization:** Not implemented (would use JWT/OAuth in production)
- **Email/Notification:** Mocked via console logs; real integration would use external services
- **File Uploads:** S3/object storage integration is planned, not implemented
- **Queue Durability:** Redis Pub/Sub is non-durable; for production, use RabbitMQ/Kafka
- **Single Region:** Multi-region failover not implemented, but architecture supports it
- **API Gateway/Security:** Not included, but recommended for production
- **Data Volume:** Designed for thousands of users; can scale further with above strategies

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful Commands
- **Start the stack:**  
  `docker compose up --build`
- **Run tests:**  
  `docker compose run app npm test`
- **Stop everything:**  
  `docker compose down`
- **View logs:**  
  `docker compose logs -f`
